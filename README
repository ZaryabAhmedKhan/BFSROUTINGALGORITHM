# BFS Routing Simulator

This project is a Java-based routing simulator that demonstrates the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It allows users to create dynamic graphs, add nodes and edges, and visualize the shortest path between a selected source and destination.

## Features
- Interactive GUI using JavaFX
- Add or remove nodes and edges
- Simulate BFS to find the shortest path
- Random graph generator
- Visual path highlighting
- Log panel for step-by-step tracing

## Technologies Used
- Java 17
- JavaFX 17
- IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans

## How to Run
1. Ensure Java 17 and JavaFX are installed.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ or NetBeans.
3. Run the `BFSRouting.java` file.
4. Use the GUI to build and simulate your graph.

## Folder Structure
- `BFSRouting.java` – Main GUI and controller
- `Graph.java` – Graph logic and BFS implementation
